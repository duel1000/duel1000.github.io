<h2>Obsessed</h2> 

<p><strong>21 April 2021</strong></p>

<p>
I watched a new video on YouTube. Addison Rae - a TikTok superstar with about 80 million followers - performing her new single "Obsessed", live on Jimmy Fallon. On TikTok she primarily does 10-15 second dance videos that are pretty silly, but entertaining. Often there are friends and family joining her, which makes it quite joyful. It seems like a valid form of entertainment. A good spirit and a happy mood. 	
</p>

<p>
I watched the live performance of her new single on Jimmy Fallon. Then I watched the music video. And then I watched it again. Then I watched the live performance once more. And then I watched the music video, again. I sort of had to. I had no idea what to think. Everything seemed good on the surface. It sounded nice. The dancing was dynamic. So, why did I not like it? 
</p>

<p>
I wanted to know what other people tought about it, so back to YouTube. First I saw a couple of reactions from minor youtube channels. The sort of channels where the camera setup is not right and the guy is sitting in a chair in front of a boring background. And sure enough, you see the Demon of Sex gripping them when Addison gets on the bike. Being a man, you know exactly what they are thinking and what they want to do. You see the satisfaction on their face. You see them being tickled by their naughty thoughts. What are they going to say about it? The truth? Well, they praise the video. What else could they do? It is easy to see how the producers hits a home run here. A perfect fucking home run. It feels like breaking the world. 
</p>

<p>
Some of the more established YouTube channels gave her a really bad review, obviously. I wanted to know what I really thought of it, so I went downstairs to ask my wife for help: "Look, here is this new single for the world, watch it with me." And she knows me. She knows when there is something I need help understanding. 20 seconds in my wife immediately said the video was bad. She almost had a hard time watching it. I had watched the entire video more than 10 times before I could think anything about it at all. Well, Addison is stripping. Through the entire video. And she does it in an orgie of other female dancers. Nothing in the performance makes any sense. There is no story to it. Everything oozes of sex. Bad lyrics, bad composition, cheap sounds. It grabs your attention for a miserable short time. To me, it feels like there are invisible demon-puppeteers hanging from the ceiling pushing the music forward. Rather unsetteling. 
</p>

<p>
A bit horrified about the situation, I have started a small journey where I try to expand my own taste in music and listen to new albums. It is easy to find recommendations and just start listening. Maybe I should thank Addison and her producers? They certainly propelled me forward into learning more about music. 
</p>

<p>
We generally listen to new things in the house now so it has been quite the transformation. If you are unsure what to aim for you can at least say: "Clearly, I do not want THAT!" - and then go for the opposite. It is like reading a war book. It tells you just how well you have it now and makes you grateful. So weirdly enough, I am grateful this happened. 
</p>

<p>
I should probably get on the line here and recommend an album, this article being about taste and all. Feel free to judge.
