<h2>Why the Website?</h2> 

<p><strong>6 April 2021</strong></p>

<p>
Well... writing lets me think. Alone, in my office, at the keyboard. I love to do it. Every day I write about something. Personal issues, anything I want to learn, relationships, ideas, confrontations, tension. Everything that comes to mind. And therein lies the problem. It comes to mind at a very fast pace, and I write it down quickly. Which is great. I really like to do it. But often is lacks precision and it feels unthoughtful, which is not that great.
</p>

<p>
Unthoughtful thoughts.
</p>

<p>
I want higher precision, so I can aim better in life and share whatever I find with the people around me. The Website simply acts as an audience and it forces me into editing what I write. Slowing down the pace.
</p>

<p>
It does not seem wise to let random people in with your un-edited thoughts. 
They should be tried out in conversation where the counterpart can help you through the process. 
</p>

<p>
Not that I think anyone will ever read this, that is not the point.
</p>

<p>
To sharpen the Sword of Light just seems valuable.<br><br>
</p>

<p>
Of course there are more reasons, but that is the main one.<br><br>

It helps me ship things.<br>
It gets me on the hook. <br>
It helps me share. <br>
...<br>
It tests me.<br>
It scares me.<br><br>

Happy reading!<br>
