// @todo: Jeg kom hertil

Now I was walking on a rooftop with a lot of people sitting there.

I had to pee, so I stumbled my way through all the people, who I think were musicians from the koncert.

They were all dressed in white, like nurses from a psych ward.

They were all silent, and they were all looking at me while I passed through.

They were sitting so close that it was hard to put a foot down, but they did not seem to care.

I got from one platform to another, and here was the door to the toilet, which actually is the door in my parents house to the boiling room, where there is no toilet.

I got past the brown colored man who smiled at me, and went into the "bathroom". 

I stood in there thinking: "what is going on, I feel weird...", just before I opened the door and returned out to the platform. 

They were all looking at me, with these white garments on. 

"look, you are all men!", I announced to break the silence. 

"Except one", she said. I had missed a woman in the middle, a black fat woman who liked more like a man: "Oh yes, of course. One woman right there", I said and pointed with intent. 

I sat down almost next to her. It was getting late, and I needed to go back to the hotel or where it was I stayed.
