	<h2>The Italian Man</h2>

<p>
I had this fantastic but also horrorful dream. It started with me wanting to impress two models who were looking at me, while this weird and wonderous instrument was playing to the side. When it stopped I took the instrument to a back room and one of the models with long legs and long dark brown hair came along and sat against the wall listening to me playing. She did not look at me while I noticed her beautiful figure. The instrument was a long weirdly curved shaved flute, with a bunch of small holes for tricky fingerplay. It also had two or three mouthpieces to blow in. It was filled with drool from the previous user, but I did not care. I put my mouth to the end and tried blowing air in it. No sound came out - only faint bubbly drool-like sounds. 

<br><br>She just sat there.<br><br>

After five minutes of trying, a brown colored man came and asked if he could show me the tunes. He placed his head on a different hole than I had, and out came this beautiful music. Now I forgot everything about the model. I was intrigued by him, his black rasta hair, his dark toned muscles and of course his ability to play. I knew the music was of the highest order, and I respected it a lot. 
</p>

<p>
I realize now that the dream started earlier than that. It started with me being in an appartment with different people, and my two brothers, Kim and Jakob. Kim was the big brother and did not say much. Jakob, on the other hand, was gleeming. He was happy, his back was straight as an arrow, and he had lost some weight too. He was clearly motivated about this whole concert situation, and he told me something like: "Look, Martin! My back is straight and my shoulders aren't turned the wrong way anymore, look what I can do!", and he flexed his shoulders to and fro. "I joined a musical, and when I sing I have to stand straight like this, so apparently now I am straight!". I cannot recall if I said anything, but I was clearly intrigued by the idea. 
</p>

<p>
Back to the brown dude with the rasta hair. He invited me to come with him. A blink later we were sitting in a sort of open rail train, with no roof over us. And we were talking. He asked me what I do, and I had a very hard time telling him, that I was a software engineer. It was almost like I choked on the words. I told him that I released a game called Deadliners, and he seemed impressed and happy about that. I told him that I knew music was of the highest order of things, and that music was the most meaningful experience one could have. Music is like a general wave of meaning. I talked more about it would and that it would be a good idea for me to spend more time learning to play. I wanted to tell him that I have good rythm and sense of music, but I lack the ability to play an instrument. The rail train came to a halt, and suddenly New York was visible off to the side. With all its scyscrabers and all of its magnitude. Buildings clearly pointing towards a beautiful sky. This gave sort of a pause to the dream. 
</p>

<p>
Now I was walking on a rooftop with a lot of people sitting there. I had to pee, so I stumbled my way through all the people, who I think were musicians from the koncert. They were all dressed in white, like nurses from a psych ward. They were all silent, and they were all looking at me while I passed through. They were sitting so close that it was hard to put a foot down, but they did not seem to care. I got from one platform to another, and here was the door to the toilet, which actually is the door in my parents house to the boiling room, where there is no toilet. I got past the brown colored man who smiled at me, and went into the "bathroom". I stood in there thinking: "what is going on, I feel weird...", just before I opened the door and returned out to the platform. They were all looking at me, with these white garments on. "look, you are all men!", I announced to break the silence. "Except one", she said. I had missed a woman in the middle, a black fat woman who liked more like a man: "Oh yes, of course. One woman right there", I said and pointed. 
I sat down almost next to her. It was getting late, and I needed to go back to the hotel or where it was I stayed. 
</p>

<p>
A skinny italian looking guy asked me, if I wanted to go to the city with him. He knew the way. A moment after we were walking on a path, that came right next to a food shop, which had a greasy looking sign and the name said something about burger. Inside the italian man did something really rude, I do not recall. Maybe he shat on the patty frier or something, while the fat white cook was out in the back. The cook shouted at me while we left.
</p>

<p>
Behind the burger bar, a path started going uphill, twisting. The italian man ran, and I ran after. It was getting steeper all the time, and I could hardly follow. He was always just ahead, so I could see his shadow. Steeper and steeper, until the path was almost vertical, and I had to climb. I could see him at the top of the path, waving to come. He wasn't smiling anymore. The last part of the path was made of small rocks, like a mediaval farmers wall. The stones were loose, and some of them fell down when I grabbed them. My body stiffened, I was afraid to fall. On small step at a time, my fingermuscles burning with fear, I got a han on the top. On top of the wall, an old man was sitting, looking away. He seemed resentful. When I was about to pull myself up, with what was left of my strength, he hooked his foot around my leg, so I could not get up. I begged the italian man to help me, but he didn't. He was just there, looking. The old man hang tight, and I struggled to get his goddamn foot off me, rocks falling down the path. 
</p>

<p>
I got to the top, and rolled my body over so tired. Then things switched to third person camera, and I watched my body roll into the rusty looking metal box that was on top of the path, hanging a couple of meters about the ground. It looked like a meat grinder, taking right out of a horror movie or a pigs slaughter. The thing started pumping on my body, now I saw the blood cling to its sides. The red dark blood in the night. The italian man was just looking, waiting. Several "thumbs" came from the machine, no one was screaming. I don't know if the old man was there, or if I had shoved him down the path. More "thumbs" and blood spatter on the ground, with a sound like when you throw a bucket of water onto pavement. 
</p>

<p>
A large white bag fell from the machine, with me in it. It was rectangular, and looked like a garden soil bag. No arms or legs sticking out, just the white bag. It lay on the ground, still. The italian man came and cut it open once along the length. Another bag became visible, with dirt and blood all over. It said something like: "Best mans garden soil" or: "Only bad soil makes good plants" or: "A bags man of flesh to soil!". I do not recall all the names that came through, when the italian man opened bag after bag until I got the association that the entire mess looked like a kale cut open along the side with a sharp knife, so all the leaves stick out open like a broken rib cage. My final thought was: "Just like an eggplant". Then I woke up, not feeling too well.
