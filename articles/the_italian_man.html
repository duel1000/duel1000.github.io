	<h2>The Italian Man</h2>

<p><strong>September 19, 2017</strong></p>
<p>
I had this fantastic and vivid, but also horrorful dream. It started with me wanting to impress two models who were looking at me, while this weird and wonderous instrument was playing to the side. When it stopped I took the instrument to another room. One of the models with long legs and long dark brown hair came along and sat against the wall listening to me play. I was very much aware of her beautiful figure, but she did not look at me. The instrument was a weirdly curved shaved flute, with a bunch of small holes for tricky fingerplay. It also had two or three mouthpieces to blow in. It was filled with drool from the previous user, but I did not care. I put my mouth to the end and tried blowing air in it. No sound came out - only faint bubbling drool-like sounds. 

<br><br>She just sat there.<br><br>

After five minutes of trying, a brown colored man came and asked if he could show me the tunes. He placed his mouth on a different hole than I had, and out came this beautiful music. Now I forgot everything about the model. I was intrigued by him, his black rasta hair, his dark toned muscles and of course his ability to play. I knew the music was of the highest order, and I respected it a lot. 
</p>

<p>
I realize now that the dream started earlier than that. It started with me being in an appartment with different people, and my two brothers, Kim and Jakob. Kim was the big brother and did not say much. Jakob, on the other hand, was gleeming. He was happy, his back was straight as an arrow, and he had lost some weight too. He was clearly motivated about this whole concert situation, and he told me something like: "Look, Martin! My back is straight and my shoulders aren't turned the wrong way anymore, look what I can do!", and he flexed his shoulders to and fro. "I joined a musical, and when I sing I have to stand straight like this, so apparently now I am straight!". I cannot recall if I said anything, but I was clearly intrigued by the idea. He has a history of many back-related problems.
</p>

<p>
Back to the brown dude with the rasta hair. He invited me to come with him. A moment later we were sitting in a sort of open rail train, with no roof over us. And we were talking. The trail was riding next to a river bank. New York was visible off to the side with its scyscrabers and all of its magnitude. Buildings clearly pointing towards a beautiful sky. This gave sort of a pause to the dream. It was our destination. He asked me what I do, and I had a very hard time telling him, that I was a software engineer. It was almost like I choked on the words. I told him that I released a game called Deadliners, and he seemed impressed and happy about that. I told him that I knew music was of the highest order of things, and that music was the most meaningful experience one could have. Music is like a general wave of meaning. I kept talking about it and also told him it would be good for me to spend more time learning to play. I wanted to tell him that I have good rythm and sense of music, but I lack the ability to play an instrument. The rail train arrived at the destination.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I was walking on a rooftop with a lot of people sitting there. The roof was on one of the big skyscrabers and was long and narrow. I had to pee, so I stumbled my way through all the people, who I think were musicians from the earlier concert. They were all silent and dressed in white, like nurses from a psych ward. Everyone followed me with their eyes as I passed in between them. It was hard to place my feet because the people sat there so closely. They did not care about it. I got from one platform to another, and here was the door to the toilet. The door was actually the door outside my parents house to the boiling room, where there clearly is no toilet. I got past the brown colored man who smiled at me, and went into the "bathroom". I stood in there thinking: "What is going on, I feel weird...", just before I opened the door and returned out to the platform. They were all looking at me, with these white garments on. "Look, you are all men!", I announced to break the silence. "Except one", she said. I had missed a woman in the middle. A black fat woman who looked more like a man: "Oh yes, of course. One woman right there", I said and pointed with intent. I sat down almost next to her. It was getting late, and I needed to go back to the hotel where i stayed apparently.
</p>

<p>
A skinny italian guy asked me, if I wanted to go to the city with him. He knew the way. A moment after we were walking on a path right next to a food diner, which had a greasy looking sign. The name said something about burgers. Inside the italian man did something really rude, I do not recall. Maybe he shat on the patty frier or something, while the fat white cook was out in the back. The cook shouted at me while we ran away laughing. It was dark outside.
</p>

<p>
Behind the diner a path started going uphill, twisting. The italian man ran, and I ran after. It was getting steeper all the time, and I could hardly follow. He was always just ahead of me, so I could see his shadow. Steeper and steeper, until the path was almost vertical, and I had to climb. I could see him at the top of the path, waving for me to come. He was not smiling anymore. The last part of the path was made of small rocks, like a medieval farmers wall. The stones were loose, and some of them fell down as I grabbed them. My body stiffened, and I was afraid to fall. One small step at a time, my fingermuscles burning with fear. I got a hand on the top of the wall where an old man was sitting, looking away. He seemed resentful. When I was about to pull myself up, with what was left of my strength, he hooked his foot around my leg, so I could not get up. I was sweating very much. Why did he hook me? I begged the italian man to help me, but he didn't. He was just there, looking. The old man's leg was tight around mine, and I struggled to get his goddamn foot off me, rocks falling down the path.
</p>

<p>
I got to the top of the wall, and rolled my body over so tired. Drained. The dream changed to a third person perspective now. Next to the wall there was a big rusty metal box, elevated a few meters off the ground. It looked like a big meat grinder, right out of a horror movie or a pigs slaughter house. I watched my body roll into the box. The thing started pumping on my body, and I saw the blood cling to its sides. The red dark blood of the night. The italian man was just looking, waiting. "Thumb.. thumb.. thumb...". I don't know if the old man was there, or if I had shoved him down the path. Blood splattered to the ground with a splashing sound - like emptying a large bucket of water onto pavement.
</p>

<p>No one was screaming.</p>

<p>
A clean large white bag fell from the machine. It looked like a bag of garden soil. I knew my body was inside. No arms or legs sticking out, just the white bag. It lay on the ground, still. The italian man cut it open once along the center length with a box cutter. Another layer of bag became visible, with dirt and blood all over. Text was written on it in with big letters, like font for a slogan. I cannot remember precisely what it said, but it was something like: "Best mans garden soil!" or "Only bad soil makes good plants!" or "A mans bag of flesh to soil!". I felt very exposed, mocked and naked against the world. The italian man kept opening new layers of the bag with the box cutter. More slogans. The entire mess ended up looking like a cabbage cut open with a sharp knife, all the leaves sticking out like a twisted broken rib cage. There was a hollow feeling to the whole situation. 
</p>

<p>My final thought was: "Just like an eggplant".</p>

<p>
I woke up, not feeling too well. I immediately spent 45 minutes writing down the dream.
